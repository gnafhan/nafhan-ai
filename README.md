     ```
4. **Run the Application:**
   - Start the backend and frontend servers.
   - To start the backend, execute:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     python backend.py
     ```
   - For the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` directory and install dependencies and start the development server:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```

5. **Access the Application:**
   - Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the **Nafhan-AI** web interface.

Now you're ready to use **Nafhan-AI** and start working with machine learning models through the web-based interface.
## Usage

1. **Upload Data:** Upload your data to the system via the web interface.

2. **Select Model:** Choose from pre-existing machine learning models or upload your own.

3. **Run Predictions:** Execute predictions using the selected model on your uploaded data.

4. **Review Results:** Visualize and analyze the model's output within the application.
